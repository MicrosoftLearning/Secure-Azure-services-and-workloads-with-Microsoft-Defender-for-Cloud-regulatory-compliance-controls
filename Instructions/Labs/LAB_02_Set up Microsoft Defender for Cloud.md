# Lab 01: Create a virtual network infrastructure
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You can use a network security group to filter inbound and outbound network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. 

Network security groups contain security rules that filter network traffic by IP address, port, and protocol. When a network security group is associated with a subnet, security rules are applied to resources deployed in that subnet.

## Skilling tasks

- Create a network security group and security rules
  
- Create application security groups
  
- Create a virtual network and associate a network security group to a subnet
  
- Deploy virtual machines and associate their network interfaces to the application security groups
  
- Test traffic filters
